# Word of the Day

# What is this?
An app which displays new words in five languages, every day. While the users can learn new words, the program’s service collects and uploads usage data (from gyroscope, linear acceleration, gravitational and rotational vector sensors) to a Dropbox account, to analyse it 
if a theft happened.

# Why you started such a project?
This is my graduation project for my undergraduate studies, collaborated with Cem Sağlam.

# Any problems? 
Feel free to inform, will fix it ASAP.
